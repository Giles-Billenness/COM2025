# README

This is a ruby on rails website for modelling pc builds (Pc component lists).
I have used HAML, JavaScript, Jquery and many more technologies in this project.
The component tables are populated with seeds, however the build table is populated manually

To run: open terminal in the main dir (on machines that can run rails), execute "rails s" and navigate to localhost:3000.
